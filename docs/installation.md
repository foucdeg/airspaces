# Installation

In development:
- webpack-dev-server listens on the port 3000
  - it serves your frontend app's bundle.js
  - it manages hot reloading



## Start the app

What you need to do to (re)start the project:

- start the frontend:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  yarn install
  yarn start
  ```

  The project should now be running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
